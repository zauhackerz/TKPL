        h1 Have you ever ...

      section.fullscreen
        h1 ... hated slideshow presentations for the fact,&nbsp;...

      section.fullscreen
        h1 ... that the sentence you were just reading&nbsp;...

      section.fullscreen
        h1 ... is on a slide that just vanished?

        h1.bullet While on the good old blackboard,
        h1.bullet everything stays for quite some time
        h1.bullet just because the lecturer is too lazy
        h1.bullet to wipe it out.

      section
        h1.bullet Well, then here is the solution.
        ul
          li This is a theme for <a href="https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke.js/">bespoke.js</a>
          li It works with any existing bespoke.js presentation

      section
        h1.bullet How It Works
        ul
          li Slides fill half the screen or more if they contain much content
          li The remaining space is used to display preceding slides in compacted form
          li The theme clearly higlights the current slide
          li But gives you the freedom to look back
          li The slides are always in 4:3 format ... <span class="bullet"> to ensure your formatting works on any screen
          li But additional space is still used for the previous slides

      section
        h1 Give it a <a href="https://github.com/tebbi/bespoke-theme-terminal">try</a>!
